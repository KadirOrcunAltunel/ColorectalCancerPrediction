The dataset used for this project is a colorectal cancer histology dataset, which was used along with a vision transformer model. The Colorectal cancer histology dataset contains 5000 histological images of 150x150 pixels. There are also 8 labels, which refer to the different textures in colorectal cancer histology. The labels are the following: Adipose , Complex, Debris, Empty, Lympho, Mucosa, Stroma, Tumor. Furthermore, the images in this dataset are RGB and were digitized with an Aperio ScanScope and magnification 20x. See below for examples of the images with the labels.
