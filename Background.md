Colorectal Cancer is a type of cancer that originates in the colon or rectum and as the name entails, it is often grouped together due to its similarities. Both the colon and rectum are parts of a key component of the digestive system. The colon structure is as follows:
- Ascending Colon: Begins with the cecum and travels upward on the right side.
- Transverse Colon: Crosses the abdomen from right to left.
- Descending Colon: Moves downward on the left side.
- Sigmoid Colon: S-shaped, connects to the rectum.

Most of the time, colorectal cancer begins as polyps in the colon or rectum. Polyps are dangerous since they can become cancerous over time. Some types of polyps include: Adenomatous Polyps, Hyperplastic and Inflammatory Polyps, Sessile Serrated Polyps (SSP) and Traditional Serrated Adenomas (TSA). 

Some factors that increase the risk of cancer include polyp size, number, and dysplasia (abnormal cells). Cancer can also spread through the colon and rectum and into the blood which can spread to distant organs. There are different Types of Colorectal Cancer, with the most common being: Adenocarcinomas, and the less common: Carcinoid Tumors, Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GISTs), Lymphomas and Sarcomas.

Just like Colorectal Cancer, there are other multiple types of cancer that are a leading cause of death in the United States. The cancer mortality rate in the United States is 146 per 100000 men and women per year. And one of the factors for this is cancer treatment delay. There was a study done to be able to quantify the association of cancer treatment delay and the conclusion was that it does have a big impact and is definitely a problem in the health system worldwide.

Luckily, with the advances in AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning, there are models that can help with faster diagnosis and increased accuracy. So, overall, these models can be very helpful in enhancing decision-making in cancer prognosis and accelerate the treatment process as well.The use of deep learning has been widely used in tasks such as: imaging diagnosis, digital pathology, and cancer prognosis. Cancer prognosis involves predicting cancer outcomes, recurrence probabilities, and patient survival estimates. In this project we will be focusing on Colorectal Cancer Prediction.
